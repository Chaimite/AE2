# AE2
Chryptography assignment
This assignment asks a user for the name of an unput file (the file must exist in the src directory, or the p
program will crash)
The file name introduced will end in P or C (i.e CommonC). If the file name ends in P, the code will encode the text
contained in the file, if it ends in C, it will decode the .txt file.
The user must then introduce the key for the cypher, a word that will be used to code and decode.
Two cyphers are used, the MonoAlphabetic and the Vignere cyphers.
To change between any of these, it must be commented out in the main, AE2.
This program encodes and decodes a message, and creates a .txt file that gives the statistics about 
the use of letters.
